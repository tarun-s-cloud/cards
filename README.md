# Cards

Welcome to the Cards project! This repository is a Python-based application designed for processing card-related functionalities. It currently leverages Tesseract OCR for text extraction, making it an essential component for certain features.

## Short Description

The Cards application serves as a framework for handling card-related data, incorporating capabilities for image processing and text extraction using Tesseract. Currently, the project is not fully functional in a deployment environment due to the absence of `tesseract.exe`.

## Structure of the Project

Here’s a breakdown of the project structure:

```
├── Procfile               # File for specifying the commands that are executed by the app on deployment.
├── README.md              # Documentation file for the project.
├── __pycache__            # Compiled Python files.
│   ├── app.cpython-313.pyc
├── app.py                 # Main application file where the core functionalities are implemented.
├── driving_face           # Directory possibly containing resources or models related to driving face detection.
├── functions              # Directory containing helper functions for the application.
├── __pycache__            # Another compilation directory.
│   ├── extraction.cpython-313.pyc
├── extraction.py          # Module responsible for image text extraction functions.
├── index.html             # HTML file, potentially for frontend display.
├── render.yaml            # YAML configuration file, usage may vary.
├── requirements.txt       # File listing Python package dependencies.
├── uploads                # Directory for uploading files, likely containing user-input images.
```

## Features

- **Text Extraction:** Utilizes Tesseract OCR for text extraction from images (requires installation of `tesseract.exe`).
- **Image Handling:** Supports the uploading and processing of images related to cards.
- **Modular Design:** Organized code structure for easy navigation and scalability.
