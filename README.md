# Cards

## Short Description
Cards is a Python-based application that implements card recognition functionalities. Currently, the deployment is not operational as it requires the `tesseract.exe` executable for optimal performance. 

## Features
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities for card reading
- Simple and intuitive interface for card input
- Detailed recognition output with potential future enhancements
