# Cards

Welcome to the Cards repository! This project is designed to facilitate operations related to card processing but currently requires `tesseract.exe` for successful deployment.

## Short Description

The Cards project has been developed in Python and serves as a foundational tool for various card-related functionalities, including card recognition and data extraction. Please note that deployment is not functional at this moment due to the dependency on `tesseract.exe`.

## Features

- Card recognition and data extraction capabilities
- Simple and easy-to-use interface
- Built with Python for flexibility and compatibility

## Installation

To get started with the Cards project, please follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarun-s-cloud/cards.git
   cd cards
   ```

2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the necessary packages (check `requirements.txt`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Tesseract OCR**:
   You will need to install `tesseract.exe` on your system. Follow the instructions specific to your operating system:
   - **Windows**: Download the installer from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - **Linux**: You can install it via package manager:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
     ```
   - **macOS**: Use Homebrew to install:
     ```bash
     brew install tesseract
     ```

## Usage

To use the Cards functionality, ensure that `tesseract.exe` is properly installed and included in your system's PATH. Then, run your Python scripts as needed:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

> **Note**: Make sure to replace `your_script.py` with the script you intend to execute.
