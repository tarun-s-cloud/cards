# Cards

## Project Overview
The **Cards** project is a Python-based application designed to work with card recognition and processing. However, it currently requires the `tesseract.exe` executable for deployment, which may limit its functionality in certain environments. The project aims to provide a robust solution for card data extraction and manipulation.

## Installation & Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarun-s-cloud/cards.git
   cd cards
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Tesseract:**
   - Download and install Tesseract OCR from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
   - Make sure to add the Tesseract installation path to your system's PATH environment variable.

4. **Verify installation:**
   You can verify that Tesseract is installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```

## API Documentation

### Main Functions

- **`process_card(image_path: str) -> dict`**
  - **Description:** Processes the given image of a card and extracts relevant information.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `image_path` (str): The path to the image file of the card.
  - **Returns:** A dictionary containing extracted card data.

### Utility Functions

- **`load_image(image_path: str) -> Image`**
  - **Description:** Loads an image from the specified path.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `image_path` (str): The path to the image file.
  - **Returns:** An Image object.

## Functions & Classes

### Key Functions

#### `process_card(image_path: str) -> dict`
- **Parameters:**
  - `image_path`: A string representing the path to the image file.
- **Returns:**
  - A dictionary with keys corresponding to card attributes (e.g., name, number).

### Example Usage
Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use the `process_card` function:

```python
from main import process_card

card_data = process_card('path/to/card/image.jpg')
print(card_data)
```

## Configuration

Currently, the project does not have specific configuration options or environment variables. However, ensure that the Tesseract executable is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
