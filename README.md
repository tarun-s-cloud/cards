## Short Description
The **Cards** repository is a Python-based application designed for processing card images. However, it may not function properly during deployment due to the requirement of `tesseract.exe`, an optical character recognition (OCR) engine that is necessary for image processing features.

## Features
- Image uploading and management
- Optical character recognition using Tesseract
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance
- HTML interface for user interaction

## Installation
To set up the Cards application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tarun-s-cloud/cards.git
   cd cards
   ```
   
2. **Install prerequisites:**
   Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Install Tesseract:**
   - Download the Tesseract installer from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) for Windows users or use package managers for Linux/Mac.
   - Add the Tesseract installation path to your system’s PATH environment variable.

4. **Install required packages:**
   Use pip to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is set up:

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application interface.

3. **Upload images:**
   Use the provided interface to upload and process card images.
